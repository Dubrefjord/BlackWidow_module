Forked from mirdeger/bw to have all code associated with ModuleMatcher in one place.

# Run

1. Add chromedriver to your path

Example for current directory on linux:

PATH=$PATH:.

2. Run the scanner

python3 crawl.py --url http://example.com

# ModuleMatcher compatible

To make the crawler compatible with ModuleMatcher, some code has been added in crawl.py,
Functions.py and Classes.py. To find them, simply search for "matcher" in the code.

For more information, visit https://github.com/Dubrefjord/ModuleMatcher which has a propper README file! :)
